**CORPORATE LIFT** Solidarity is an almost entirely digital matter, controlled by the software and networks of tech corporates. People find each other, a job, a lodging house, and a concert using the same technology that watches over their health, guides them through traffic, or educates them. They feel connected to various online groups around the world, and they combine multiple roles and identities that are all linked to one GP (global passport). This gives rise to a strong sense of belonging. Your personal profile provides easy access to a variety of online interest groups. The global uniformity of cultural products is easy to recognize and a local test ensures that people easily recognize themselves in the characters and environments from the corporates’ advertising messages. For others, it becomes too much: they can’t find their way in the profusion of superficialities (which used to be called overchoice, but is now simply known as navigation fatigue). Others get bogged down in solitude.

**CLIMATE CASCADE** Solidarity is strong and people often come together in physical gatherings. There is a great mutual solidarity that takes shape in small-scale, local sharing and strong back-to-basics attitudes. Nobody is excluded. Manual labor, repairs, and DIY bring people with various backgrounds and competences together physically. Digital platforms provide an overview of the available competences and resources. When danger is brewing due to toxic clouds or acid rain, warnings are trumpeted about both digitally and by a local city announcer. Those who are too far away from home can take shelter in the common area of a nearby sub-house.

**LOCAL SENTRY** There is great solidarity within close-knit communities of ‘good citizens.’ They look up to the higher placed political and economic authorities and count on them to guide the local economy in the right direction. Newcomers are expressly not allowed to join if they cannot contribute. Belonging means: adhering to a fixed pattern of comings and goings. Algorithms ensure that nobody acts ‘outside the box’ through civilian credits. Those who deviate from the standards lose credits. Assessments from fellow citizens matter greatly in this regard. This way, the best possible quality of life is guaranteed for the local community in difficult circumstances. Shortages are experienced less strongly because they are the same for everyone. Every adult is expected to contribute a minimum number of hours to maintaining infrastructure or caring for the weak as a volunteer. Cultural activities are organized by neighborhood associations and a small number of national societies. The holidays are celebrated wholeheartedly and preparing for them is the main theme in joint social and creative activities in a family context or with neighbors.

**ECLECTIC CURRENT** Solidarity within super-diverse Ghent is high. A wide spectrum of minorities are the majority. There is no dominant section of the population, but a fluid definition of citizens’ identities. Social organization assumes that everybody is equal, which is experienced as such in practice. People have great confidence in fellow citizens and in the government. Nearly every individual is an integral part of a permanently changing society. Digital connectedness supports the physical solidarity between families and neighborhoods, school communities, and workplaces as well as the physical solidarity in the cultural landscape.
