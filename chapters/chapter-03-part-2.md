## Diary entry from a volunteer

February, 5th 2040
Credits: 9.2

This afternoon, I was rushing to complete all my missions of the day, and in the Koele Ketelstraat, I ran into Anna. Anna’s husband Koen lost his job in the pharmaceutical industry last year. Back then, cyber 4.0 finished off the local representation of his company. By now, virtually the entire neighborhood knows that he can’t seem to get out of the social care system. Through Bob, I’ve learned that he vainly tries to qualify for government selection procedures, but with his miserable social credit score, he can definitely forget about that. After his studies, Koen didn’t complete any of the standard criteria, such as those for Thrift, Marriageable Age, or Social Support of the Community. Moreover, they are gradually growing too old to have children, which means they can’t even earn points for Family Management. It was almost embarrassing how jealous Anna reacted when I told her that Bob had just managed to win his umpteenth long-term project at the government. Anyway, thanks to this encounter that occurred while I was jogging around, I managed to boost my social score in addition to my health credits this afternoon - two birds in one stone!

I can no longer write, because I still have to go to the park later to prepare everything for the Easter party tomorrow. Just now, I had a look at the neighborhood’s digital intersection. (GH)EN(T)joy. A fair number of local traders already enrolled for manning a stand! Through the forum, I just became a candidate for taking care of decoration, because that is what I’m good at. Later, after my round at the seniors, I will drop by there to brighten up everything and properly decorate the stands. I hope that we will attract as many people this year as we did last year. The holidays are important moments: they emphasize that we still have a lot to celebrate, even after the fall of the consumer paradise that our parents grew up in. While celebrating, we also celebrate the hope we cherish. Many people join in. It brings us closer together and helps us through the bad times.

Now, I really have to leave. After all, I still have to cook at Karin’s, and drop by at Katia’s. She’s really aged since she fell. While I’m there, I will suggest to take them in tow to the neighborhood party tomorrow. This way, they’ll also get out for a change (and hopefully, I will be treated to a credit bonus afterwards!).
