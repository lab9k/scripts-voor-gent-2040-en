title: Desirable futures
indentlevel: 1
---

We combined the elements of a preferable future
in the vision described below:

In a complex reality where digitization and automation keep gaining pace, we strive for sobriety, simplicity, and straightforward connections between existing systems. We aim for solidarity and social contact, meaningful activities, qualitative leisure, and sustainability. Ghent will become a region full of talent and the go-to climate city in Flanders where mobility is a basic right and where people think globally in a co-creative way.

When writing the scripts, we took into account
what our respondents deemed preferable for the future.
Visions of what is important for (people in) Ghent were
also starting points for our initial thematic sessions and
meetups. During these meetings, we collected original
input on what is desirable to our participants and what
they wish to avoid.
 
The speed with which digitalization and automation
evolve, the complexity involved and its impact on todayâ€™s
value frameworks, is experienced as problematic by many
of the participants. When shaping the futures, this translates
to (1) the importance of social contact, (2) adapted
time management (around principles of activity and leisure),
and (3) adapted spatial interpretation (vacancy,
green in the city).

According to the participants, a preferable future
of Ghent is therefore characterized by (a) solidarity
and inclusion, (b) welfare (labor, leisure, mental
and physical health) , (c) livability (urban space
and mobility), supplemented by the requirement
of (d) (ecological) sustainability.
{:.vision}

The participants believe that for this purpose, (i) knowledge
sharing, constant (ii) innovation, (iii) co-creation, and
(iv) entrepreneurship are paramount. 

Governments, companies, research and educational institutes
as well as citizens are jointly responsible for working
towards these targets.4 These can only be realized when
facilitated by a combination of:

* Adapted and easily accessible, connected technologye; 
* Adapted and easily accessible governments;
* Adapted attitudes, manners, and behavior of citizens
and companies.

(v) Intercommunication between the different actors and
(vi) inclusiveness are seen as necessary conditions for this.
