Compass: Facilitating role of government and technology
{:.chapter-intro}

**CORPORATE LIFT**
The local government locally facilitates the international companies that
pull the strings globally. It guarantees regulations that allow the economic
players to continue their profitable but ecologically sustainable
activities. Huge commercial databases containing resident profiles have
now replaced the population register. Traffic in the city is controlled by the
Artificial Intelligence of private technological service provider SLIM (urban living
intelligent mobile) and the related road infrastructure has also become the
responsibility of the corporates, which control an increasingly larger part of the
public space as a result. Gradually, the conscious choice has been made to minimize
the government’s role to offer the corporates room for their ecological measures, thus
decreasing the number of jobs for civil servants considerably.
Technological progress is also at the basis of the possibilities for sustainable production,
distribution, and consumption. The fourth industrial revolution has become a sustainable
story in which the corporates achieved economies of scale, but could also work increasingly
locally. The algorithms ensuring this are deployed for the personalization of goods and services
as well as the organization of public life and the public space. In Flanders, the servers
supporting this method can largely be found in Ghent. Supporting their operation ensures
local employment. The development and implementation of new applications for analysis
and control are also a Ghentian affair.

Technologische vooruitgang ligt mee aan de basis van de mogelijkheden voor duurzame productie, distributie en consumptie. De vierde industriële revolutie werd een duurzaam verhaal waarin de giganten weliswaar schaalvoordeel halen, maar ook steeds meer lokaal gericht konden gaan werken. De algoritmes die hiervoor zorgen, worden ingezet voor de personalisatie van goederen en diensten en voor de organisatie van het publieke leven en de publieke ruimte. De servers die deze werkwijze ondersteunen zijn voor Vlaanderen grotendeels in Gent te vinden. De ondersteuning van hun werking zorgt voor lokale tewerkstelling. De ontwikkeling en implementatie van nieuwe toepassingen voor analyse en sturing, is eveneens een Gentse aangelegenheid. 

**CLIMATE CASCADE**
The Ghentian government gives the greatest possible elbow room for community
initiatives and individual entrepreneurship. The democracy has
weakened considerably, because the government can guarantee neither
social care for the relatively large group of poor people, nor relief for
damages suffered in violent weather. The Europe of the regions could
not enforce European social policy, because it was not financeable.

The most interesting recent innovations are those that enable
various generations and standards of technology to work together. Such
applications offer guidance within an eclectic whole of interconnected technologies.
Technology is an important tool for micro-entrepreneurs and micro-taskers. Consumer
electronics and services come from automated factories in Asia and the US. Despite the
recession, personal devices and networked organizations are still the norm.    

**LOCAL SENTRY**
Local governments are strongly intertwined with local life.
National and European governments work with tight budgets.
They oversee the definition of a suitable course of life.
This makes it easier for people to make career- and family-
related choices. They constantly interact with extensive
digital government services. The government guarantees
social security - hardly ever through benefits, but by providing
shelter places for those who would otherwise fall by the wayside.
The infrastructure is provided by the government, but services are
entirely in the hands of female volunteers from the local community. Only those who have
a higher civilian credit balance are eligible for government jobs.

Innovation is at the service of the status quo - with specific focus on applications to make
the local economy work efficiently. The government cooperates with local IT companies
on persevered digital monitoring and the certification of citizens. School children are also
followed. In the field of education, digital content and delivery systems throughout Belgium
offer the same program. Not only do machines follow the comings and goings of all citizens,
they also make this information accessible to everyone 100%.

**ECLECTIC CURRENT**
Technology is transparent and open source and is put at the service
of livability and humanity. It is developed in consultation with the
large players that have opened their source codes for over 10 years
now. Security issues are a concern from the past: technological systems
are designed for trust rather than security.

Local governments have great autonomy. Like other organizations,
they work together in federations with other governments to provide a solid foundation for
the transformation that has occurred over the past 20 years. Direct democracy supports an
engaged autonomous local government. Autonomous digital services for domain-related
consultation and debate make old-fashioned forms of representation superfluous. Strong
governments guarantee geo-political negotiations and take measures for a well-functioning
local economy in their region. There are online cap & trade auctions for all basic materials
and natural resources. The government imposes a basic income as well as a maximum
income. Price regulation forces prices to be directly proportional to cost. All economic players
need to negotiate with the government on the measure of profit for reinvestment.
