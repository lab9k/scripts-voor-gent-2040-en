**Welcome to Ghent 2040**. The explorers of the future,
consisting of the Digipolis Foresight team and researchers
at the Open Time Research Center, invite you on a journey
into the future. We will travel no less than 22 years forward
in time. Of course, we cannot predict what will happen,
what choices we will make, what opportunities and
challenges await us, or which (un)expected events will
shape our environment. Nevertheless, we can reflect on
what could lie beyond the horizon of the next few years.
Whatever happens, Ghent is making its way into the future
through a complex and sometimes contradictory present.
These scripts and the accompanying compass can be used
as orientation tools. We focus on the technologies that we
use for the purpose of working, learning, living, and playing,
and that can simultaneously be drivers of change as
well as what is being changed.

**Welcome to Ghent 2040**. Little is still the same as 23
years ago, when over one hundred Ghentian civil servants
and dozens of experts looked at how this city could evolve
in the coming decades. Then, our starting point consisted
of nine themes, which formed the backbone of our exploration.
The keywords for these themes were: social city,
climate city, mobile city, residential city, entrepreneurial
city, learning and creating city, safe and livable city, participating
city, city organization.

**Welcome to Ghent 2040**. Using a <span class="need-clarification">horizon scan*</span>, input
from thematic experts, a range of future sessions, a conference,
and workshops with civil servants from the City of
Ghent, we collected the building blocks for four very different
images of the future. These building blocks give concrete
shape to the future possibilities which we discuss.
They are the factors and actors, the facts and functions
that were used to build the scripts.

A horizon scan is performed by systematically
searching the media and other channels for signals
that can help you anticipate changes in the environment,
threats and opportunities, which are only
scarcely visible today.

**Welcome to Ghent 2040**. When writing these scripts,
we took into account which elements were marked as
‘preferable’ in the whole of activities, working documents,
reports, and memos. These elements of a preferable future
can be combined in the vision described below:

In a complex reality where digitization and
automation keep gaining pace, we strive for sobriety,
simplicity, and straightforward connections
between existing systems. We aim for solidarity
and social contact, meaningful activities, qualitative
leisure, and sustainability. Ghent will become
a region full of talent and the go-to climate city in
Flanders where mobility is a basic right and where
people think globally in a co-creative way.{:.vision}

**Welcome to Ghent 2040**. It is not our ambition to
build and present an ideal future here, which would be
rather naive. After all, every alternative future contains elements
that may be considered either positive or negative,
depending on the person reviewing them. We are looking
for a range of images of the future that show a spectrum
of possibilities. More and less preferable sub-aspects have
been included in each of the images. There is no scenario
in which everything goes well simultaneously, but part of
the vision is always realized somewhere. This allows us
to elucidate in a realistic way how different aspects of life
in Ghent in 2040 can be given shape to in various circumstances. 

**Welcome to Ghent 2040**. Prospects for technological
developments and their applications (from horizon scans
and project participants’ proposals) are incorporated into
the four scripts. Technological challenges do not form the
focus. Instead, we want to dwell on the way in which technology
can be used in the circumstances of the different
scripts. In any case, technology will play an important
role in daily life as well as for policies, especially when a
commitment is made to technological innovation, but also
when such innovation is weaker.

**Welcome to Ghent 2040**.  The four images
of the future that we present here have been drafted
according to the principles of the four generic alternative
images of the future of the Manoa School, developed by
the Hawaii Futures Research Centre at the University of
Hawaii2. These images of the future are starting points
which should prompt reflection and debate. Therefore,
your own images of the future complete the picture. What
is your vision? Which of the building blocks can you use to
get as close to it as possible? How do you see the role of
technology in Ghent over the next two decades?
