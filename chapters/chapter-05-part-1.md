"Who would have thought that you would still find so many things in this scenario that aren’t that bad at all? I would like to live there, in that world."

The participants in this project pointed out four major targets in their discourse on a preferable
future:

* solidarity and inclusion
* welfare (labor, leisure, mental and physical health)
* livability (urban space and mobility)
* (ecological) sustainability

Different priorities apply to each of the four scripts, and the various actors act differently in
each of the four scripts. So how about those four targets?

The compasses below indicate what is typical for each of the four targets in the four scripts.
We look at the broader context, organization by governments, companies and citizens and their
attitudes, manners, and behaviors. In doing so, we emphasize the products and services that
contribute to the whole. After discussing the four compasses, the roles of technology and governments
will be discussed for each script.

This part provides an overview of the different products and services that may contribute
to achieving specific components of the visions for Ghent in 2040 that were discussed in the
process. It gives an impression of the intended and unintended impact that certain measures,
manners, or behaviors may entail. Do you wonder what lies between the contemporary situation
and the realization of a vision? You can explore it using our compasses.
