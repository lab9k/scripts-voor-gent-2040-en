**CORPORATE LIFT** The large commercial players ensured that the economic growth is based on sustainability. More than two decades ago, they already saw that their profits were threatened by ecological decline, and they intervened with a voluntary climate agreement. Automated and robotized production units are now locally installed. Here, cradle-to-cradle principles and circular systems are used. Like in most major cities, large companies have set up upcycling and continued cycling sites in Ghent. To meet their major energy needs, large companies also bought promising and innovative startups in renewable energy. This way, they further expanded their activities.

**CLIMATE CASCADE** Sustainability is a concern from the past. Focus is placed on reducing and eliminating pollution. The air quality is poor, which seriously affects public health. The measures taken until the mid-twenties, including those for collecting and storing water or for cooling in the city by providing greenery, make life in some neighborhoods - and particularly life in the city center - still somewhat endurable. Land in and around the city is increasingly cleared for local cultivation. Excessive acid rain in winter, interspersed with long droughts in summer and sporadic precipitation from toxic clouds, don’t offer good conditions. The goal of completely banning fossil fuel from Ghent was abandoned 13 years ago. However, fuel prices have an impeding effect, both on individual users and cooperatives. Do-it-yourself energy facilities on a domestic scale are not very efficient, but are increasingly used. Recycling basic materials from waste or infrastructure that has fallen into disuse is an important economic activity that allows for maintaining a number of products and services.

**LOCAL SENTRY** Ecological sustainability issues are reduced to those of energy supply by the government. Nuclear energy and small-scale decentralized energy production by resourceful people supply the vast majority of energy. Additionally, there are energy-saving measures to ensure that local energy production does not have to be supplemented with import. Like elsewhere, the weather patterns in Europe are disrupted, but in the Low Countries, air pollution is not a problem. Practices for agriculture and cattle breeding are well adapted to the more extreme weather phenomena. Technology supports the monitoring of the environment, and there is a warning system for extreme weather and other potential threats.

**ECLECTIC CURRENT** Although Ghent is completely climate neutral, the city still has to deal with the consequences of global climate change. Rain is often acid, and in spite of applicable measures since 2020, there is periodical water scarcity. Nearly every family uses DIY water treatment technologies. Artificial Intelligence that maintains an overview promotes ecological sustainability. This monitoring allows for quickly addressing future shortages or suffered damages with specific corrective measures that are often carried out by urban robot swarms. The city’s air quality is good. Efficient energy storage systems have supported the decentralization of energy generation. Kinetic energy and body heat fuel personal devices. Everyone has information on energy-efficient solutions and digital intersections support the application of these solutions.
