We cannot predict what will happen, what choices we will make, what opportunities and challenges await us, or which (un)expected events will shape our environment. Nevertheless, we can reflect on what could lie beyond the horizon of the next few years.

Whatever happens, Ghent is making its way into the future through a complex and sometimes contradictory present. These scripts and the accompanying compass can be used as orientation tools. We focus on the technologies that we use for the purpose of working, learning, living, and playing, and that can simultaneously be drivers of change as well as what is being changed.

These images of the future are starting points which should prompt reflection and debate. Therefore, your own images of the future complete the picture. What is your vision? Which of the building blocks can you use to get as close to it as possible? How do you see the role of technology in Ghent over the next two decades?
