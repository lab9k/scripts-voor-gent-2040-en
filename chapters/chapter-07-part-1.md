title: Now, it's your turn
indentlevel: 1
---
In the preceding pages, you discovered four version of
Ghent in 2040. They were presented through a description
of the driving forces that design the specific worlds
through their interplay. We also presented you with testimonies
from two characters every time. This provided you
with bottom-up look - through the eyes of the people who
live and work in the presented worlds, giving meaning to
life. We also provided you with the compasses, making
the differences and similarities between the four version
of Ghent 2040 visible. Moreover, the compasses may offer
inspiration for the types of actions that can be taken on the
road to 2040. Finally, we described each world from the
layering that is typical of it - on the basis of characteristic
facts, systems, worldviews, and metaphors.

Now, it’s your turn. We hope that you feel sufficiently
inspired to get started with it. What do you think Ghent will
be like in 2040? Perhaps, you’re considering completely
different driving forces as starting points. Perhaps you’re
consider other technologies, materials, or organizational
structures that simplify or complicate the lives of people
in Ghent in 2040. Perhaps you can come up with a range
of different news facts for each of the scripts? Perhaps you
want to make a new combination of the best ideas from
the four scripts to create a new script. Perhaps you can
come up with a whole new basic story or an original metaphor,
based on which you create a new layered reality. Of
perhaps you want to share your opinion on the elements
you find desirable and undesirable.

We are very interested in how you see the future of Ghent’s
people and technology. Will you share your ideas with us?
Give us a call or send us an email. We are happy to discuss
everything over a cup of coffee!
