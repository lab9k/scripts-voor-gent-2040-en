## Fragment from an interim evaluation interview with her department head at Prospects

Since I transferred from the City of Ghent to this job
in the private sector, I get so much more satisfaction from
my professional life. While as an environmental planning
expert, I would get fed up with the cumbersome structures
in which we worked, I am much more pleased now. Here,
my position as an environmental consultant allows me -
albeit within the pre-established lines of our parent company
Alphanumerics - to act much more flexibly, and I can
simply get more things done in less time.

Because you feel strongly about permanent staff
training, I can closely follow the latest developments with
regard to efficient use of space and act accordingly in my
daily practice. The international coaches who confront me
with cases from other cities every week are particularly
useful. In fact, the ease with which I can communicate and
exchange views with them thanks to the holograms and
simultaneous translation robots still surprises me a little.
The problems that I am presented with there and the stepby-
step solutions we jointly look for challenge me to stay
wide awake and optimize my own tasks time and again.
I really look forward to occasionally work as an international
coach myself within a few years, when I will have
achieved my main performance indicators.

Last night, I rather feared I couldnâ€™t be present here
today. After work, I sprained my ankle on the electric
scooter that I use for my short commute. But fortunately,
thanks to the quick help of the local safety drone, which
helped me up and ensured that a cold compress spray was
ready upon returning home, I was able to recover quickly.
I did not have to leave my chair at all, as the drone also
alerted the food printer of my refrigerator, and I got a delicious
vitaminized dinner last night. Just what I needed to
be focused here today!
