Due to the crumbling of the superpowers after the tens, European regions found a new verve
based on strongly persevered technological developments. The international corporations of
the olden days keep benefiting from economies of scale, but like the international sector federations,
they currently work based on full transparency - and without seeking any profit in the EU.
All efforts are directed to permanent social and societal innovation, in addition to technological
innovation. Although the consequences of climate change are felt, the city is completely ‘climate
neutral.’ Ghent was a pioneer, which is why it is still ahead of most other Flemish cities, especially
in the area of energy supply.

**TECHNOLOGY**: Technologies continue to evolve rapidly.
They are transparent and open source. Technological systems
are designed for trust rather than security. An autonomous,
intelligent digital hub provides local material and
social solidarity with respect for privacy. It also steers
health, mobility, supply, and infrastructure of wireless
electricity as well as urban <span class="need-clarification">swarm robotics*</span>.

* Multi-robot systems that consist of large numbers
of simple robots and whose collective behavior
arises from the interactions between the robots and
the interactions of the robots with the environment
are called swarm robotics.

**POPULATION**: Ghent has a super-diverse population. A
wide spectrum of minorities are the majority. There is a
fluid definition of identities with attention to equality.
People live on extremely small surfaces, often as families,
but also in co-housing projects. Because of the complexity
of social relationships and the limited separation between
life and work, the mental health of some members of the
population is jeopardized.

**ECONOMY**: In Flanders, profit is a concept of the past,
to the regret of those who believe that their standard of
living and the reward for individual efforts are deteriorating.
This is a well-balanced, steady-state economy, which
means there is no economic growth. Overproduction or
overconsumption are avoided. Production is done locally
and quality is centralized. Each company is a social company.
In addition, there is a well-functioning sharing economy.
Cyber systems keep the flow of goods and services
in balance. Minimum and maximum incomes and price
regulation are imposed by the government.

**ECOLOGY**: Ghent is on track to realize its climate
ambitions. The air quality is good here. Extreme
weather phenomena, however, are difficult to deal
with by solely taking local measures. The intermittent
water scarcity is illustrative of this. The transition
to ecological sustainability is partly made possible by
systems driven by Artificial Intelligence.

**ENERGY**: Ghent almost exclusively uses renewable energy.
Good energy storage systems have enabled the decentralization
of energy generation. Kinetic energy and body heat
fuel personal devices. The transportation of goods and
passengers has decreased significantly in volume.

**CULTURE**: Solidarity and social connectedness between
generations and people of diverse ethnic origin are strong.
A ‘good life’ and societal solidarity are central in life in
Ghent. There is a strong ‘urban culture’ in Ghent, which
means that there are diverse opportunities for different
target audiences within a relatively small surface. Residence,
work, and life are intertwined. There are no specialized
residential or trade districts. These functions are
intertwined. Urban agriculture also exists in every district.
Bridges between people with very different cultural backgrounds
are built by means of technological applications,
but even with this support, the variations become too
much for some.

**POLICY**: Local governments have great autonomy. Like
other organizations, local governments join forces by
working together in federations. It is their goal to embed
the transformation that occurred in the past twenty years.
Direct democracy supports engaged autonomous localization.
