"Nobody knows what
the future will bring.
Yet we cannot help but
dwell on it."

**S1. CORPORATE LIFT**

A European and global economic growth policy has further
strengthened the dominant position of the tech giants and
other corporations in the <span class="need-clarification">oligopoly*</span>. The standard of living
is high. Privacy has become a concern of the past. Being
tracked by machines is common (and, in fact, quite useful)
to people. The government is left with minimal responsibilities.
It acts as facilitator for the giant economic players
in favor of ecologically sustainable growth.

*An oligopoly (from the Greek words oligos, ‘little,’
and polein, ‘sell’) is a market that is only dominated by
a few suppliers. In this market form, an economic product
or a service is offered by a handful of large companies.

**S2. CLIMATE CASCADE**

Fast and far-reaching climate change initiated a domino
effect disrupting the global economy. Cooperatives
of micro-entrepreneurs in a variety of sectors rely on old
technological platforms for their work. The level of solidarity
among Ghentians is high. The government guarantees
the infrastructure for connectivity and allows bottom-up
initiatives free scope to realize small-scale solutions to
large-scale problems.

**S3. LOCAL SENTRY**

Ghentians fully commit to their own local welfare and
support each other’s bottom-up initiatives in a situation
in which the standard of living is under pressure. A transparent
digital monitoring and credit system encourages a
modest life along the beaten path. By providing extensive
digital government services, among other things, local
governments are strongly intertwined with local life.

**S4. ECLECTIC CURRENT**

Profit is a concept of the past, to the regret of those who
lost their socio-economic lead as a result. Thanks to governments’
devotion to far-reaching technological support
on all conceivable services, Ghent has become
a successful, super-diverse city. All efforts are
directed to permanent technological, social, and
societal innovation. Although the consequences of
climate change are felt, the city is completely ‘climate
neutral.’

**THE COMPASS**

None of these futures will probably become reality in the
outlined form. However, some of their characteristic traits
will become visible in Ghent and the world, either in the
short or in the long term. If we look closely, we can spot
them. That is why a compass is included in this document.
A tool for properly navigating towards a preferable future,
it contains pointers with indications of driving forces,
building blocks, and their consequences for the main elements
of the visions for Ghent which we developed with
our participants. After all, the potential futures that we
want to evolve to are not simply displayed for us.

**LAYERED REALITIES**

In each of the outlined images of the future, we meet two
Ghentians who live their lives in these realities. To dig even
deeper, we use the Causal Layered Analysis technique.
This allows us to first describe the facts that are visible
on the surface. Subsequently, we examine the systems or
societal structures that these facts are embedded in. Then,
we identify the worldviews that form the foundation of
these systems, as well as the myths and metaphors which
support these worldviews. This way, we make the deeprooted
bases of our images of Ghent’s future explicit.

**HOW ABOUT YOUR IMAGES OF THE FUTURE?**

Finally, we would like to propose a fifth image of the future
with an accompanying compass and a layered presentation.
This is more than a merging of the foregoing. It
is a reinterpretation with new combinations of building
blocks.

Ultimately, it is our aim that everybody (including you)
creates their own image of the future - one that you keep
adjusting as you move through the world and through
time. This image of the future will differ per person. If you
share your ideas with us, we will include them in our ongoing
efforts to think about a preferable future for our city.
The more Ghentians think along about the futures of their
city, the better these futures become. Enjoy the ride!
