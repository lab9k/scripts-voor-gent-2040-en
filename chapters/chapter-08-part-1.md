**Chronology**
The above-presented four versions of Ghent 2040 didn’t
appear out of the blue. They are largely based on the information
collected in an initial process within Group Ghent:
On 17 February 2017, Digipolis Foresight organized an
inspirational moment - we called it a future session - allowing
experts to share their views on the roles of technology
in the future of the Mobility and Environment & Climate
domains.

On 16, 19, and 22 May 2017, a total of seven creative and
more in-depth workshops were organized, during which
colleagues from Group Ghent explained and further elaborated
their views on possible futures. Here, too, the central
approach was the relationship between technology and
society.

On 6 June 2017, a second future session was held with
‘Technological trends for the government’ as its theme.
Experts gave presentations on (big) data, VR/AR, Blockchain,
and increasing participation in policy through technology,
among other things.

Ultimately, everything built towards 7 September 2017:
the Foreplay conference. All day long, more than three
hundred interested people were inspired by the importance
of future thinking and the role of technology in
Ghent as a ‘City of People,’ and finally, they got to work in
co-creative workshops.
Finally, led by Applied Futures Research, there were also
a Scenario Exploration System workshop (25 September
2017), a Causal Layered Analysis (9 October 2017), and a
backcasting session (16 October 2017).
More than 100 individuals from within the Group Ghent
were involved in the workshops - and over 250 others were
involved in the public showings (the future sessions and
Foreplay). In the four versions of Ghent 2040, they will find
their own ideas as well as the insights provided by the
experts.

**About Digipolis Foresight**
Digipolis Ghent has a Foresight team since October 2016.
The team works on:
* Exploration of the future. We look for possible futures
for Ghent in different ways, working co-creatively to the
highest possible degree. We pay extra attention to the
relationships between people and technology in Ghent.
* Innovation and experiments. The future is not fixed. We
create it together. We bring various partners together
around experimental and future-oriented projects. We
constantly do this from the City-of-People vision: people
and societal needs come first, and technology is a
means, not a goal.
* Strategy and policy. Foresight wants to help design the
future, but also wants to work on
* the road that leads to it. With a view to the long term, we
also work on short-term realizations.
* (International) Collaboration. We are the contact point
for collaboration projects that Digipolis is involved in -
locally, nationally, and internationally. Collaboration is
also central to the City-of-People vision. We refer to the
‘quadruple helix:’ citizens, civil society and companies,
academia, and government.

**Applied Futures Research**
The Applied Futures Research knowledge center is a collaboration
between the Tourism & Recreation Management,
Communication Management, and Idea & Innovation
Management programs from the Management, Media,
and Society department at the Erasmus University College
Brussels.
We develop practice-based methods and instruments for
future research and collaborate with societal actors to
encourage and strengthen future thinking in a variety of
contexts. We aim for added value from future research for
companies, nonprofit organizations, governments, education,
activism, communities, and society. We encourage
long-term thinking providing insight into methods and
approaches, concrete tools, training, coaching, and tailor-
made activities.
